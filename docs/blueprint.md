# **App Name**: OWASPedia

## Core Features:

- OWASP Top 10 Overview: Provide a comprehensive overview of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, explaining each category with clear definitions.
- Detailed Vulnerability Tutorials: Offer in-depth tutorials for each vulnerability, including technical details, potential impacts, and real-world examples.
- Code Example Demonstrations: Include code examples (both vulnerable and secure) to illustrate how vulnerabilities can be exploited and how to prevent them.
- Diagrammatic Explanations: Incorporate diagrams and visual aids to explain complex concepts and attack vectors related to each vulnerability.
- Security Best Practices Tool: Generative AI powered "tool" that uses an LLM to provides best practices based on the type of threat, and provides reasons for why to include that practice.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to inspire trust and security.

- Body text: 'Inter' sans-serif, for modern readability.
- Headlines: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for impact and clarity; use 'Inter' for the body text to ensure excellent legibility.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' monospace for code readability.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent each OWASP Top 10 category.
- Implement a clear, hierarchical layout with plenty of whitespace for easy navigation.
- Use subtle animations to highlight important concepts.
